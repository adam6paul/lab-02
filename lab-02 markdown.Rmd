Lab 02

``` Setup Steps
First, I need to load the tidyverse.

library(tidyverse)

Reading the datafile we'll be working with.

plastic_waste <- read.csv("data/plastic-waste.csv")


``` Exercises!

The first thing the exercise has us do is look at the data broadly.

What the code below is doing, for my own sake, is using ggplot to create a graph. 
  Data = plastic_waste picks out the dataset
  aes is aesthetics, which is the basic layout of the graph, such as...
  x= what is on the x-axis
  + indicates the next step in the process
  geom_histogram is picking out a histogram. geom indicates the family of graphical procedures.
    Remember the documentation will have these different commands, as will a google search.
  Binwidth picks how much data is contained within each bar.

ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)

#Setup Steps

First, I need to load the tidyverse.

library(tidyverse)

Reading the data file we'll be working with.

plastic_waste <- read.csv("data/plastic-waste.csv")


#Exercises!

The first thing the exercise has us do is look at the data broadly.

What the code below is doing, for my own sake, is using ggplot to create a graph. 
  Data = plastic_waste picks out the dataset
  aes is aesthetics, which is the basic layout of the graph, such as...
  x= what is on the x-axis
  + indicates the next step in the process
  geom_histogram is picking out a histogram. geom indicates the family of graphical procedures.
    Remember the documentation will have these different commands, as will a google search.
  Binwidth picks how much data is contained within each bar.

ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)

Looking at the graph, there's an outlier way away from all the others. One way we're shown to find out what country
  is to filter for only results that are above a cutoff point

plastic_waste %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap > 3.5)

This reveals that it is Trinidad and Tobago.



#Question 1

1.1. Plot, using histograms, the distribution of plastic waste per capita faceted by continent. What can you say  about how the continents compare to each other in terms of their plastic waste per capita?

ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x=plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2) +
  facet_grid( ~ continent)

What I notice is that North America, South America, and Asia are the only three that break .5 per capita.
  Of these three, the one with the most, by a good margin, is NA. 
  The continent with the average appearing to be the lowest is Africa, though that may be a consequence of lowest usage.
  Uniquely, though there are some high producers in Asia, it comes the next closest (on average) to lowest waste per capita.



#Question 2

For the next part, we're looking the same information using a density plot. Several iterations are done, resulting in the one below.

ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent, 
                     fill = continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7)

However, we can improve upon this too.

2.1. Recreate the density plots above using a different (lower) alpha level that works better for displaying the density curves for all continents.

ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent, 
                     fill = continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2)

After exploring some, I found 0.2 to be a good number that reveals the full set.

2.2. Describe why we defined the color and fill of the curves by mapping aesthetics of the plot but we defined the alpha level as a characteristic of the plotting geom.

We used aes for the color and fill of the curves because if we didn't we wouldn't get the legend with information about what the colors mean. defining alpha level as a characteristic is fine because we don't need to include it in the legend, as it is being done for visualization purposes. However, not knowing what each colour means would make the graph basically useless.

#Question 3

Another way to visualize the data is with side-by-side box plots.

ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = continent, 
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_boxplot()


3.1. Convert your side-by-side box plots from the previous task to violin plots. What do the violin plots reveal that box plots do not? What features are apparent in the box plots but not in the violin plots?


ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = continent, 
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_violin()
  
The violin plot reveals that there is a massive amount of skew in North America.
